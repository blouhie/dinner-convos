<p>In 1994, 12 black women coined the term reproductive justice. It is "the complete physical, mental, spiritual, political, social, and economic well-being of women and girls, based on the full achievement and protection of womenâ€™s human rights" as Loretta Ross describes. Fighting against reproductive oppression and misinformation is essential for our liberation.</p>
