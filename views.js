<h3>About</h3>

<p>
	In 1994, 12 black women coined the term “reproductive justice,” or "the complete physical, mental, spiritual, political, social, and economic well-being of women and girls, based on the full achievement and protection of women’s human rights" as Loretta Ross describes. Fighting against reproductive oppression and misinformation is essential for our liberation.
</p>

<p>
	In 2021, 6 women of color were brought together by their shared interest in reproductive justice at the Feminist Future(s) Hackathon—Tia, Julie, Krithika, Dina, Althea and Tanvi. We believe in the power of healthy conversations to plant seeds for change. Conversations for Every Dinner  Table is a resource that reframes traditionally taboo and stigmatized topics related to reproductive processes so we can feel comfortable talking about them openly, learn from one another’s lived experiences, and have fun. By the end of the game, we hope that players can feel more connected with their own bodies as well as others’, more equipped to step outside of the oppressive narrative framework, and more confident in defining our own criteria of normalcy and care.

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<p>
As the title suggests, Conversations for Every Dinner Table is suitable for intimate or social group gatherings. Conversations may take place among groups of 2 - 7 people of friends and families, between generations, and across genders. With the presence of a mediator, this game can be used to facilitate educational public programs, such as school workshops, public library offerings, or Trivia Night at local bars, using the digital version (currently work-in-progress). If there is a use case you’d like to suggest or discuss with us, please feel free to send an email to ffrj2021@googlegroups.com. 
</p>

<p>
There are 2 types of cards to draw from in this deck: Prompt Cards and Key Cards. First, separate the Prompt Cards and Key Cards into 2 separate decks.
</p>

<h3>PROMPT CARDS</h3>

<p>
Prompt Cards invite responses from players, starting a conversation. They are divided into seven topic categories: 
</p>

<p>
Postpartum | Menstruation | Pregnancy | Menopause | Sex | Abortion | Reproductive health 
</p>

<h3>KICKING OFF THE GAME</h3>

<p>
At the beginning of the game, each player draws seven Prompt Cards, one from each category. Alternatively, for a quicker game, shuffle all the categories together and ask each player to draw only four Prompt Cards. 
</p>

<p>
Any player can volunteer to kick off the game by picking one of their cards and reading the prompt written on the card out loud to the group. Some prompts will ask the player to answer a question, while others may instruct the player to draw something or share a story. Below are the types of prompts:
</p>

<p>
Answer a Question | Reflect | Guess | Think Wildly | Draw | Tell A Story
</p>

<p>
The player will respond to the prompt first, then invite other players from the group to respond to it, creating a conversation. 
</p>

<h3>KEY CARDS</h3>
<p>
If a player finds it difficult to come up with an answer or the conversation experiences hiccups, draw a Key Card to help move the dialogue forward. They are:
</p>

<p>
Mirror | Silence | Swap | Speculative | Affirmation 
<br>
Think Positively | Listen Deeply | Sit In Stillness
</p>

<h3>MOVING ON</h3>

<p>
Once all the players agree to move on from the first Prompt Card, the next player (your choice of clockwise, counterclockwise, or popcorn) will continue by reading out one card of their choice.
</p>

<h3>EXIT</h3>

<p>
You do not have to finish discussing all the cards in order for this game to end. Like other dinner table conversations, this one is not rigid either.
