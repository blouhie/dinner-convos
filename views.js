<p>
	In 1994, 12 black women coined the term reproductive justice. It is "the
	complete physical, mental, spiritual, political, social, and economic
	well-being of women and girls, based on the full achievement and
	protection of womenâ€™s human rights" as Loretta Ross describes. Fighting
	against reproductive oppression and misinformation is essential for our
	liberation.
