      <h3>About</h3>

      <p>
        In 1994, 12 black women coined the term reproductive justice. It is "the
        complete physical, mental, spiritual, political, social, and economic
        well-being of women and girls, based on the full achievement and
        protection of womenâ€™s human rights" as Loretta Ross describes. Fighting
        against reproductive oppression and misinformation is essential for our
        liberation.
